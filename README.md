# MedicalDiagnosticApp
## Machine learning based initial diagnostic medical app using a public dataset from Kaggle.
Utilized 2 supervised random forest models, the first predicts if the patient is positive or negative 
with any disease given their symptom input and health demograph after cleaning the dataset.
The second then predicts the highest probable disease if the first model comes out as positive, the second
model is low in accuracy currently do to a low dataset, however accuracy will increase with higher dataset volume.
